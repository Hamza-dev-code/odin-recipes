            into a bowl. Stir baking soda into water.</li>         
        
        <li>Put dates and prunes in a large bowl. Pour baking soda-water over dates and prunes; 
            add unsalted butter and stir until melted. Stir sugar and vanilla extract into the fruit mixture; 
            let cool to room temperature.</li> 
        
        <li>Stir egg into the fruit mixture to evenly coat. Mix flour and salt together in a small bowl;
